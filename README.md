### Properties

`UPCarouselFlowLayout` has a few customizable properties:

* `sideItemScale` (between 0 and 1, default is 0.6)
*Can be set through code or via Interface Builder.*
The shrinking ratio for collection items which are not in the center.

* `sideItemAlpha` (between 0 and 1, default is 0.6)
*Can be set through code or via Interface Builder.*
The opacity ratio for collection items which are not in the center.

* `sideItemShift` (value in pixels, default is 0)
*Can be set through code or via Interface Builder.*
A vertical/horizontal offset (depending on the collectionView scroll direction) for collection items which are not in the center.

* `spacingMode` (default is fixed spacing of 40 pts)
*Can be set only through code.*
  * `UPCarouselFlowLayoutSpacingMode.fixed(spacing: CGFloat)`
Items in the carousel are positioned with a fixed space between them.
  * `UPCarouselFlowLayoutSpacingMode.overlap(visibleOffset: CGFloat)`
A fixed part of the side items are visible on the sides of the collection (and therefore the space between items depends on the collection size).
